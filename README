Here shall reside the exercises from "The C++ Programming Language" by Stroustrup,
ISBN 978-0321563842, plus some additional helpful C++ snippets and wanderings.

The exercises are published online and are subject to change, so they are
checked into the repo as well. If you want to find a particular solution, don't
try to use numbers -- just grep. Task description is always copied into the
solution.

Normal day of a person working on this code starts with:
    cmake -H. -GNinja -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
    cmake --build build -- -v

Another supported build types are Debug and Release.

Tested on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed.

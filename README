Here shall reside the exercises from "The C++ Programming Language" by Stroustrup,
ISBN 978-0321563842, plus some additional C++ snippets and quick checks.

The exercises are published online and are subject to change, so they are
checked into the repo as well. The solution targets have consistent naming
scheme: "chapter-name_solution-dir-name". Every solution has its main.cc.
Exercise descriptions are copied in main.cc, so they are greppable.

Normal day of a person working on this code starts with:
    cmake -H. -Bbuild -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
    cmake --build build -- -v

Another supported build types are Debug and Release.

Tested on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed.

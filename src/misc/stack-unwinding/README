Working example of stack backtrace using Boost.backtrace (which pulls
Boost.assert and Boost.exception). Best effort to generate a backtrace will be
applied upon segfault, failed assert and exception. This is very useful,
because some users might not be able to to generate high-quality backtrace with
debugger, and/or the error might be obvious just from the stack trace.

'Debug' build type is the best, although 'RelWithDebInfo' sometimes generates
sensible backtraces too. Others not tested.

One thing to note: real software using this should always print the precise
version of itself (up to vcs revision) at the beginning, because otherwise line
numbers will be scewed and the whole point of not using a debugger is
disregarded.
